# 5 Minute GitOps Pipeline with `bedrock`

The best way to start learning about GitOps in Bedrock is to walkthrough a simple sample deployment that captures our recommended approach using [Fabrikate](https://github.com/Microsoft/fabrikate). You will be using the Bedrock CLI aka `bedrock`. In this walkthrough, we will:

* Build a sample microservice and link a Helm chart to a High Level Definition [**TODO LINK**] üîÆ
* Generate Kubernetes manifests backed by a Git-based source of truth üöÄ
* View end to end observability of the microservice deployment üî≠

## Step 1: Install `bedrock` and dependencies

### Pre-req

* An Azure subscription with an existing [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/)
* Ensure the [latest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) version of Azure CLI is installed
* [Azure DevOps extension for Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devops-cli-extension). To install run `az extension add --name azure-devops && az login`
* An [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) project, organization, and read/write/manage [access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page)

### Installation

`bedrock` is available on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms.

* Download the latest `bedrock` binaries [here](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock-cli/releases). 

* Install with Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew update && brew install bedrock-cli
   ```

## Step 2: Setup a sample GitOps environment with `bedrock`

Next `bedrock` will do the heavy lifting of creating [repositories](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/docs/ADORepos.md), [pipelines](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/azure-devops/ManifestGeneration.md), and [cloud resources](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/azure-devops/ImageTagRelease.md#create-a-service-connection-to-acr) for you. Please read about Bedrock Concepts [**TODO LINK**] to get more familiar.  

1. Run `bedrock setup`
2. Hit enter to confirm the preselected value that is in parenthesis. Otherwise a new value for the prompt
3. If redirected to an Azure Portal sign in page, login and return to the shell prompt.  

Example command and results below:
```ShellSession
$ bedrock setup
info:    az cli vesion 2.5.1
? Enter organization name
 contoso
? Enter project name
 fabrikam
? Enter your AzDO personal access token
 ****************************************************
? Would you like to create a sample application repository? Yes
? Do you want to create a service principal? Yes
info:    attempting to login to az command line
? Select one of the subscriptions
 CSE Dev Crews Americas West
info:    attempting to create service principal with az command line
info:    Successfully created service principal with az command line
? Enter Azure Container Register Name. The registry name must be unique within Azure
 contosoacr
 Create variable group
 ‚úÖ Install manifest repo
 ‚úÖ Install hld repo
 ‚úÖ Install and verify manifest pipeline
 ? Enter storage account name
 contosoazurestorage
 ‚úÖ Update variable group
 ‚úÖ Install helm repo
 ‚úÖ Install sample app repo
 ‚úÖ Install and verify lifecycle pipeline
 ‚úÖ Install and verify build pipeline 
```

> Note: If you prefer not to use the interactive (immediate feedback for each statement) mode of `bedrock setup` you can provide a config file. See [docs](https://microsoft.github.io/bedrock-cli/commands/#master@setup).

**üéâ Congratulations! üéâ** At this point your have created the [simplest form](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/PipelineThinking.md) of a Bedrock GitOps pipeline. Next let's get a closer at what we have created.

## Step 3: Observe the `bedrock` GitOps flow

We can see a live report of the `bedrock` GitOps journey we just completed in _Step 2_ using Bedrock's [Spektate](https://github.com/microsoft/spektate/) dashboard. Follow the instructions below to follow along 

1. Ensure you have Docker running locally. You can download Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
2. Run `bedrock deployment dashboard`, you will be redirected to the localhost webpage in your default web browser.
3. _If the page doesn't load on first try please refresh the webpage._

Example below:
```console
$ bedrock deployment dashboard
info:    Pulling dashboard docker image
info:    Launching dashboard on http://localhost:4040
```

You will see a row of data in the Spektate dashboard as seen below. Feel free to click on links on Spektate to see the builds and pull requests that `bedrock` GitOps process automated:

‚≠êÔ∏è If you have an existing Kubernetes cluster, the Spektate dashboard will indicate when your application has been synced with the cluster. Learn about how to get a Kubernetes cluster integrated in _Next Steps_.

## Next Steps

In this walkthrough we created a GitOps workflow of repositories and build pipelines. In addition, we were able to capture telemetry from the build pipelines to display the journey of the sample application to a Kubernetes manifest repository.
