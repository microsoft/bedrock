# Creating GitHub Repos for GitOps

## Setup

## 1. Create HLD Repository

If you have not already, create your own high level definition repository.  (We provide a [sample GitHub repo](https://github.com/andrebriggs/fabrikate-sample-app) that you can fork and modify for your own application.)

Also, make sure you have (Depending if you want an AzDO pipeline or Github action workflow)
1) an [azure-pipelines.yml](../azure-devops/README.md#azure-pipelines-build-yaml) file at the root of your repository, as we will use this later to setup the build rules in Azure Devops.
OR
2) a Github workflows directory at the root of your repository, as we will use this later to setup the build pipeline in Github actions.

## 2. Create Manifest Repository

You will also need a destination repository on GitHub where the Kubernetes resource manifests will be pushed to. Create this as well if you haven't already.

Next, generate a [deploy key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/) for your new repository on GitHub. Keep the contents of your public SSH key and local path to your private SSH key handy for the next step.

## 3. Create a Flux enabled AKS Cluster

Use the content of your public SSH key and path to your private SSH key for configuring your [cluster deployment](../../cluster).

## 3. Create a Personal Access Token

In order to access the destination respository we need appropriate authentication. 

Create a GitHub Personal Access Token if you don't already have one following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure your personal access token has read/write access to private repositories.
