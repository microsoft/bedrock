# Guide: Container Image Tag Release Pipeline
This section describes an example of how to extend your [manifest generation pipeline](ManifestGeneration.md) by pre-prending a pipeline to automate incrementing your container image tag names in your high-level definition. Morever we cover a rudimentary way to perform container promotion with Azure DevOps.

We recommend following the guide to create a [manifest generation pipeline](README.md) with Azure DevOps first before attempting this scenario.

## Prerequisites

1. _Permissions_: The ability to create Pipelines in your Azure DevOps Organization.
2. _High Level Deployment Description_: Either your own [Fabrikate](https://github.com/Microsoft/fabrikate) high level definition for your deployment or a sample one of ours.  We provide a [sample HLD repo](https://github.com/samiyaakhtar/aks-deploy-source) that builds upon the [cloud-native](https://github.com/timfpark/fabrikate-cloud-native) Fabrikate definition. The one used in this example can be found [here](https://github.com/yradsmikham/fabrikate-go-server).

## Setup

The GitOps workflow can be split into two components:

1. Application Pipeline -> High-Level Definition Image Tag Pipeline
2. Manifest Generation Pipeline

We will be focusing on the first step in this example.

![ADO Two Components](images/ado-two-processes-diagram.png)

## Application Pipeline -> High-Level Definition Image Tag Pipeline

### 1. Create Repositories and Personal Access Tokens

Create both high level definition (HLD) and resource manifest repos and the personal access tokens that you'll use for the two ends of this CI/CD pipeline.  We have instructions for how to do that in two flavors:
* [Azure DevOps](../docs/ADORepos.md)
* [GitHub](../docs/GitHubRepos.md)

### 2. Create Application Code Pipeline

Using Azure DevOps we created an Azure Pipelines YAML file that describes the build and Docker images publish to Azure Container Registry (ACR). Below is an example of this yaml pipelines.

```
trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu-16.04'

variables:
  GOBIN:  '$(GOPATH)/bin' # Go binaries path
  GOROOT: '/usr/local/go1.11' # Go installation path
  GOPATH: '$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/gopath' # Go workspace path
  modulePath: '$(GOPATH)/src/github.com/$(build.repository.name)' # Path to the module's code

steps:
- script: |
    mkdir -p '$(GOBIN)'
    mkdir -p '$(GOPATH)/pkg'
    mkdir -p '$(modulePath)'
    shopt -s extglob
    shopt -s dotglob
    mv !(gopath) '$(modulePath)'
    echo '##vso[task.prependpath]$(GOBIN)'
    echo '##vso[task.prependpath]$(GOROOT)/bin'
  displayName: 'Set up the Go workspace'

- script: |
    go version
    go get -v -t -d ./...
    if [ -f Gopkg.toml ]; then
        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
        dep ensure
    fi
    docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/go/src/github.com/andrebriggs/goserver -w /go/src/github.com/andrebriggs/goserver iron/go:dev go build -ldflags "-X main.appVersion=$(build.BuildNumber)" -v -o bin/myapp
    az login --service-principal --username "$(SP_APP_ID)" --password "$(SP_PASS)" --tenant "$(SP_TENANT)"
    az acr build -r $(ACR_NAME) --image go-docker-k8s-demo:$(build.BuildNumber) .
  workingDirectory: '$(modulePath)'
  displayName: 'Get dependencies, build image, then publish to ACR'
```

This Azure Pipeline Build YAML file will be based on the application code that you are trying to build and deploy. The YAML shown is an example from: https://github.com/andrebriggs/go-docker-k8s-demo. You should create your own application that pushes your own container registry.

### 3. Add Environments to High Level Definition Repo
Most Kubernetes deployments will utilize multiple _environments_. Our Bedrock GitOps process allows you to configure values for multiple environments. We can do this by adding (ENV_NAME).yaml files to the `config` directory of your high-level definition repository.

<pre>
High-Level-Definition-Repo
├── azure-pipelines.yaml
├── config
│   ├── common.yaml
│   └── <b>DEV</b>.yaml
│   └── <b>QA</b>.yaml
│   └── <b>PROD</b>.yaml
│   └── <b>STAGING</b>.yaml
├── manifests
│   ├── ...
└── README.md
</pre>
In the example above, notice we have a configuration for environments we have container promotion to occur on. You can see an example on a HLD repo [here](https://github.com/andrebriggs/fabrikate-go-server/tree/master/config). The environment names (**bolded**) match the names of Azure DevOps release pipeline stage we will cover next.

### 4. Create Azure Pipeline Release

The Azure Pipeline Release will be triggered off of the Azure Pipeline Build that was created in Step 2, and will accomplish the following objectives:

- Clone the HLD repo
- Download and Install Fabrikate
- Execute `fab set` to manipulate HLDs
- Git commit and push to HLD repo

To start off, you can create the first stage (e.g. `Dev`) using an Empty Job template. For this example, the different stages in the pipeline resemble environments in your DevOps workflow.

![Create Stages in Release](images/releases-empty-job.png)

If the stages succeeding `Dev` are the same as the `Dev` stage, you can highlight the `Dev` stage and click `Add` > `Clone Stage`.

![Cloning Stages](images/releases-clone-stages.png)

The artifact that is used can be an ACR resource or an Azure Pipeline Build. If you would like to set it up using an ACR, there are some detailed instructions available [here](#Create-a-service-connection-to-ACR). Here, we are triggering the Release off of another Azure Pipeline Build, and enabling continuous deployment trigger.

![Artifacts](images/artifact-build.png)

![Enable Continuous Deployment](images/releases-continuous-dep.png)

The Release should look similar to the following, where updates to the build artifact will automatically trigger the execution of tasks within the stages.

![Release Environments](images/releases-env.png)

Each stage should require manual approval from a specific user in order to proceed to the next stage.

![Pre-Deployment Approvals](images/deployment-approvals.png)

Moving on to `Tasks` and highlighting `Agent Job` will bring up a side panel that allows you to select an Agent Pool that is appropriate for the task. Because the scripts will use Fabrikate, an Ubuntu 1604 Agent Pool is recommended.

![Agent Pool](images/releases-agent-pool.png)

The stages each involve two tasks: `Download scripts`, and `Run release.sh`. The `Download scripts` task downloads the [build.sh](https://github.com/Microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/azure-devops/build.sh) and [release.sh](https://github.com/Microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/azure-devops/release.sh) from the Microsoft/Bedrock repo. The inline script for `Download scripts` is as follows:

```
# Download build.sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/bedrock/master/gitops/azure-devops/build.sh > build.sh
chmod +x ./build.sh

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/bedrock/master/gitops/azure-devops/release.sh > release.sh
chmod +x ./release.sh
```

![Release Task 1](images/release-task1.png)

The `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `REPO` variables are specifically used in the `build.sh`, which is sourced in the `release.sh`. As described before, the `ACCESS_TOKEN` is the Personal Access Token that grants access to your git account. In this case, the `REPO` variable is set to be the HLD repo. You will need to add these variables as Pipeline Variables under the `Variables` tab.

![Release Pipeline Variable](images/releases-pipeline-var.png)

Additionally, add the following environment variables and the inline script to the `Run releash.sh` task:

Environment Variables:
```
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: $(ACCESS_TOKEN)
COMMIT_MESSAGE: custom message used when committing and pushing to git
SUBCOMPONENT: the subcomponent within your Fabrikate HLD that should be manipulated
YAML_PATH: the yaml path to the subkey to set (e.g. data.replicas)
YAML_PATH_VALUE: the value to the subkey
```
Also add the following environment variable 
```
FAB_ENV_NAME: the value of environment this task belongs to for example DEV or QA or PROD etc.
```
This ensures that when release runs, fabrikate will update the right environment configuration as it executes
```
fab set --environment "$FAB_ENV_NAME" --subcomponent "$SUBCOMPONENT" "$YAML_PATH=$YAML_PATH_VALUE"
```
As the subcomponent definition is updated HLD build pipeline will trigger and update the manifest repo with changes only for a specific environment.

Now add

Inline Script:
```
# Execute release.sh
. release.sh
```

Make sure to incorporate these changes for every stage in the pipeline above.

![Release Task 2](images/release-task2.png)

When this is all complete, click `Save`, and run your first Release! You can do this by navigating to the `Release` drop down at the top right, and then selecting `Create release`.

![Create a Release](images/create-release.png)

After the Release runs successfully, the new application image that was generated in the Pipeline Build (Step #2) should now be referenced appropriately in the HLD.

### 5. Clone a Release

Often, it might be useful to reuse an existing Release, than have to reconfigure a new one. You can clone a Release by selecting a Release in the left panel, clicking on the elipsis at the top right, and then selecting `Clone`.

![Clone a Release](images/releases-clone.png)

### 6. Update Manifest Generation Pipeline To Be Environment Aware

Now that we have created a release pipeline with environment specific configurations we need to make sure that manifest generation pipeline knows to generate yaml for these environments. Below is a snippet from an example [azure-pipeline.yaml](https://github.com/andrebriggs/fabrikate-go-server/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml) build file in a high-level definition repo.

<pre>
 - task: ShellScript@2
    displayName: Transform fabrikate definitions and publish to YAML manifests to repo
    inputs:
      scriptPath: build.sh
    condition: 'ne(variables[''Build.Reason''], ''PullRequest'')'
    env:
      ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: $(ACCESS_TOKEN)
      COMMIT_MESSAGE: $(Build.SourceVersionMessage)
      REPO: $(MANIFEST_REPO)
      <b>FAB_ENVS: 'DEV,QA,STAGING WEST,STAGING EAST,STAGING CENTRAL,PROD WEST,PROD EAST,PROD CENTRAL'</b>
</pre>

The **bolded** key and values represent specific environments we want Fabrikate to generate yaml for. Notice that the comma delimited values contain a subset of the environment names we configured as Azure DevOps release pipeline stages and HLD repo configuration.

Once we add the appropriate `FAB_ENVS` values the manifest generation pipeline will produce resource manifests for each directory

<pre>
Resource-Manifest-Repo
├── <b>DEV</b>
│   ├── ...
├── <b>QA</b>
│   ├── ...
├── <b>PROD</b>
│   ├── ...
├── <b>STAGE</b>
│   ├── ...
</pre>

## Create a service connection to ACR

In order to add the ACR as an artifact or reference it in azure-pipelines.yml for a Docker build task, you will need to add a service connection.

First, we will create a docker registry service connection which will help you in referencing the ACR in the build pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`) without specifying credentials.

1. Go to `Project Settings` and click on `Service connections` under `Pipelines`.
2. Add `New service connection` of type `Dockerregistry`
3. Enter details for your connection name, select the appropriate subscription and the ACR name.
    ![](./images/service_conn.png)
4. You may now use a task of the kind below, to reference this newly created service connection:
    ```
    - task: Docker@2
      inputs:
        containerRegistry: 'helloringsazure_connection'
        repository: 'hellorings'
        command: 'buildAndPush'
        Dockerfile: '**/src/Dockerfile'
        tags: 'hello-rings-$(Build.SourceBranchName)-$(Build.BuildId)'
    ```

Next, you need to add a connection for the resource group that the ACR is created on, which will help in adding an artifact to the release pipeline.

1. Go to `Project Settings` and click on `Service connections` under `Pipelines`.
2. Add `New service connection` of type `Azure Resource Manager`
3. Enter the details for the resource group which your ACR lives in.
   ![](./images/service_conn_rg.png)
4. You should now be able to link this ACR in your release pipeline by adding an artifact.
   ![](./images/artifact_acr.png)
5. Make sure to turn on the `Continuous Deployment Trigger` if you would like the release to be triggered automatically when a new build is pushed to ACR.
